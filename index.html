                        <p>Explore my AI project focused on detecting fake job listings using natural language processing (NLP) techniques with PySpark's MLlib. Leveraging a dataset of 18,000 job descriptions, including 800 labeled as fake, the project aims to automatically identify suspicious postings.</p>
                        <p>By employing advanced text processing and machine learning algorithms, I developed an NLP model to accurately flag fraudulent job ads for further review. This project showcases the application of AI in enhancing job marketplace integrity and reliability.</p>

                        <p>Delve into my data science project where I explore cricket player statistics using a comprehensive approach. The journey begins with meticulous data wrangling, employing various preprocessing techniques to refine a complex dataset with 154 columns into a focused subset.</p>
                        <p>An in-depth exploratory data analysis uncovers patterns in batting styles, national distributions, and performance metrics, offering valuable insights into the cricketing landscape. Using TensorFlow and Keras, I crafted a neural network model to predict player runs based on key metrics.</p>
                        <p>The model underwent rigorous training and evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing intricate dataset relationships. This project amalgamates data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and machine learning to unveil multifaceted dimensions of cricket statistics, providing holistic understanding and predictive insights.</p>
